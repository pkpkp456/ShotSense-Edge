    "Absolutely — we can enhance your model by **adding an attention mechanism on top of the BiLSTM**, which can **focus on the most relevant temporal frames** in the audio. Here’s a detailed explanation and reasoning:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **CNN14 + BiLSTM + Attention: Advanced Gunshot Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1️⃣ Base: CNN14 Embeddings**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pretrained on **Audioset**, CNN14 provides robust spectral and temporal feature embeddings.\n",
    "* Captures hierarchical audio patterns: low-level bursts → high-level events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ BiLSTM Head**\n",
    "\n",
    "* BiLSTM captures **temporal dependencies** in both forward and backward directions.\n",
    "* Essential for **short, impulsive gunshots** and sequences of shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3️⃣ Attention Mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why attention?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Gunshot sequences may be **intermittent**, with bursts separated by silence or environmental noise.\n",
    "  * Attention allows the model to **weight important frames** more heavily during classification.\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * BiLSTM outputs a sequence of hidden states.\n",
    "  * Attention assigns **learnable weights** to each time frame.\n",
    "  * Weighted sum → passed to Dense layers for final classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4️⃣ Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Better multi-shot detection:** Can detect multiple gunshots in the same audio segment.\n",
    "* **Noise robustness:** Ignores irrelevant frames with background noise.\n",
    "* **Interpretable:** Attention weights can show which parts of audio contributed most to the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5️⃣ Architecture Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input (log-Mel: n_mels x frames)\n",
    "       ↓\n",
    "CNN14 embeddings (frames x 1024)\n",

    "       ↓\n",
    "Output layer (2 units, Softmax)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6️⃣ Training Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Freeze most CNN14 layers; fine-tune last 1–2 convolutional blocks + BiLSTM + Attention.\n",
    "* Use **log-Mel spectrograms** as input (CNN14-compatible).\n",
    "* Use **EarlyStopping**, **ReduceLROnPlateau**, and **ModelCheckpoint** callbacks.\n",
    "* Sliding-window inference allows real-time detection on embedded systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CNN14 + BiLSTM + Attention** is the **most advanced architecture** for your use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Captures spectral + temporal features\n",
    "  * Focuses on relevant gunshot events\n",
    "  * Robust to noise\n",
    "  * Handles multiple bursts\n",
    "  * Still deployable on edge devices with optimization\n",
